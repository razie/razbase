/**
 * a two way communication stream. a stream serves one logical purpose, such as making a soa call or
 * grabbing a remote file.
 * 
 * normally this is used for a single RR (request & its response). The request could be the URL to
 * connect to (i.e. servlet) or something sent to an URL (soap).
 * 
 * optimizing the underlying communication is the job of the channel, which can handle multiple
 * streams. For instance, the channel could keep alive a TCP stream if it detects heavy traffic.
 * 
 * if you don't need a full stream created (could be heavy when serving high-volumes) just go strait
 * to the channel and ask it to read/write a message
