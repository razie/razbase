/**
 * basic drawable objects, which are rendered by Renderers for different technologies
 * 
 * Convention: each drawable MUST support at least HTML and TEXT. It SHOULD also support XML and
 * JSON. For other rendering technologies, you should create basic drawable objects in this package,
 * which will render themselves onto those respective technologies, depending on their availability
 * in a given environment.
 * 
 * The rendering as TEXT is for logging.
 * 
 * The rendering as HTML is for display in an old HTML page (form or something)
 * 
 * The rendering as XML/JSON is for marshalling/unmarshalling.
 * 
 * The other rendering formats are for display in other technologies (SWING, SVG etc).
 * 
 * There is a NATIVE rendering which means you use only native drawing elements (all defined in this
 * package). These can then render to any other technologies.
 * 
 * The preferred approach for supporting another technology is: make sure the technology is
 * XML-based. Render yourself in NATIVE and implement the xslt transformation from native to the
 * other technology.
 * 
 * Note that rendering of an item includes actionables for that item (user interaction instructions
 * and actions/commands back to the model element). Controllers are optional for managing
 * interaction (there is a defualt controller).
 * 
 * TODO Also NOTE that most of the above is to do
